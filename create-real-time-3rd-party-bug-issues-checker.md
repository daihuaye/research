# Create Real Time 3rd Party Bug Issue Checker

### Abstract
Developing high quality cross-browser web applications is challenging, there are different JavaScript engines in various browsers running in mobile phones and desktop computers. In a rapid development cycle, using third party libraries to support development is necessary. At the same time, using older versions of third libraries is common because updating to the latest libraries is time-consuming for code change and QA testing. So, in a development cycle, providing bug issues relative to the methods that developers use in those third party libraries is to reduce existing bugs found by the communities using the libraries. Many developers use methods from third party libraries without paying attention to its bug issues and release notes until they have bugs to fix.

In web development, Grunt/Gulp are common tools to provide automation features that help developers do faster development. In this paper, I will cover current work done on how to create a Grunt/Gulp plugin to be able to check bug issues in the methods used in third party libraries. And I will run the task in grunt-watch/gulp-watch in order to provide real time update. When developers use third party library methods in applications, they will get instant feedback for what happened in the current issue associated with the methods used. Using this plugin is to provide another view to avoid known bugs before QA tests and increase code quality by using third party libraries.
